# EnhancedLettersMonochrome
If you can't see the letters on the Monochrome song for FNF.
Is it too hard to read the letters in the Monochrome song? Well I have the solution for your visible problem. 
This replaces the alphabet this mod uses instead of the confusing drawings that make it difficult to type words fast.
